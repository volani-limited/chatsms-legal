# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 2025**

## 1. Overview
ChatSMS (“we”, “our”, or “us”) lets you chat with an AI assistant via SMS. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how it’s used, and your rights regarding your data.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Messages you send**: We forward your SMS messages to the OpenAI API to generate replies. Those messages are processed but **not stored long-term**, except optionally for providing support or maintaining usage credits.
- **Usage data**: We might collect aggregate data (e.g., number of messages sent, top-up usage) to help improve the service.
- **Support inquiries**: If you reach out for help, we’ll keep the message history as needed to assist.

## 3. Why We Collect It
- To process your messages through OpenAI and return a response.  
- To manage your account balance and top-ups.  
- To respond to support requests effectively.

## 4. Who Sees the Data
- **OpenAI** processes messages directly but doesn’t use them to train their models via standard API terms.  
- **Payment Processor** sees only what’s needed to process payments.  
- **Internal Team** may access minimal data for support or maintenance.

## 5. Data Security
We keep your data secure using industry-standard methods. Firestore encryption protects everything at rest and in transit—no setup needed on your part.

## 6. Your Rights
If you're in a regulated region (e.g., UK/EU under GDPR), you have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Just contact us and we'll do our best to assist.

## 7. External Links
When using external services (OpenAI, Firestore, payment processors), you can review their own privacy practices through their websites.

## 8. Contact
